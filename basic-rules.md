Following are some common rules for the game.

## Die Rolls

When you attempt a task that has a chance of failing, you roll dice to determine if your attempt succeeds or fails. All die rolls are associated one stat, called the **bonus** of the die roll. This stat is usually an attribute or a skill, but can be any number. The die roll is usually referred to by this bonus: if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Strength attribute, then it's called a Strength roll, or if you make a die roll where the bonus is your Stealth skill, then it's called a Stealth roll.

To make the die roll, roll 1d20 and add the bonus, and note the result. Your result measures how effectively you attempt the task. Compare this value to the DC set by the GM, using the table below. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.

### Levels of Success
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Result</th>
    <th>Values</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Critical Success</td>
    <td>DC + 10 or more</td>
    <td>An exceptionally good result, with bonus positive effects</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Success</td>
    <td>DC + 0 ... DC + 9</td>
    <td>You succeed at the task you were attempting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Failure</td>
    <td>DC - 10 ... DC - 1</td>
    <td>You fail at the task you were attempting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Critical Failure</td>
    <td>DC - 11 or less</td>
    <td>An exceptionally bad result, with possible negative effects</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Difficulty Classes

The DC (Difficulty Class) of a die roll is usually determined by the GM based on how hard the task seems. The GM is encouraged to used the table below to help them decide the DC. Some abilities call for a die roll against a specific DC. For example, the {Strike} power calls for a die roll where the DC is your target's AC.

### Sample Difficulties
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty</th>
    <th>DC</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simple</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Something a normal person could do with some effort</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Average</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>A task a skilled professional could struggle with</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>Requires significant training to accomplish</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Very Hard</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>Very difficult even for a skilled professional</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Extremely Hard</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>Almost impossible except for the greatest masters alive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Impossible</td>
    <td>40</td>
    <td>At the edge of human achievement, never been done before</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Turns in Combat

Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved makes an Initiative roll. Whoever gets the highest result takes the first turn. On your turn, you can use one {% icon 1-Action %} power and any number of {% icon Free %} powers. After you use a {% icon Free %} power once, it counts as a {% icon 1-Action %} power for you for the rest of your turn.

At the end of your turn, you pick who takes the next turn, ally or enemy. If you attacked a creature, that creature can choose to {Interrupt} your choice and take the next turn instead. No matter what, no one can take multiple turns in the same round. The round ends once everyone has taken a turn. The person who took the last turn in the round chooses who starts the next round.

## Movement and Zones

When the group needs a precise map of an area, usually for combat, the GM divides the game world into **zones**. A zone is an abstract area, usually about 30 feet on a side. Every character is in a zone, and multiple character can be in the same zone. You can use the {Stride} power to move between zones.

## Saving Throws

The three skills {Fortitude}, {Reflex}, and {Will} represent your character's ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Die rolls made with these skills are called **saves** or **saving throws**. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.

**Critical Success:** You take no damage from the effect

**Success:** You take half the listed damage from the effect

**Failure:** You take the full damage listed from the effect

**Critical Failure:** You take double the listed damage from the effect
