    For each +1 Mana, you can target another creature within range.
  aside: |
    ### Invisible Condition

    If you are invisible, you cannot be seen at all. This is enough to completely hide you from anyone who is not actively searching for you. Other creatures can still try to determine your location through sound clues, puffs of dust, or odd breezes. Creatures have disadvantage on Intellect+Notice rolls made to find you.

    duration: 1 hour

#     prerequisites: Illusory Object
#   effect:

#   type: 1-Action
#   traits: [Death, Emotion, Fear, Mental, Spell]
#   tags:
#     cost: 4 Mana
#     range: 120 feet
#     save: Will
#   effect: |
#     You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.

#   traits: [Mental, Spell]
#   tags:
#     cost: 7 Mana
#     range: 30 feet
#     duration: Sustained up to 1 minute
#   effect: |
#     You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn't a creature and can't benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

#     Heightened (total 9 Mana)
#     : The maximum duration you can Sustan the spell increases to 10 minutes

#     Your honeyed words are difficult for creatures to resist.
