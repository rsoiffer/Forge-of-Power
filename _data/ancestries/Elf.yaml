brief: A long-lived people with highly developed philosophy, art, and psionics
effect: |
  Elves are long-lived humanoids who are known for their grace, elegance, and culture. An elf can master many subjects over the centuries, but the years often leave them with strange eccentricities. Elves tend to develop psionic powers over the years, so the oldest elves are strange, eldritch sages with versatile knowledge and abilities.

  ### Physical Description

  Elves are the same height as humans on average. Elves are slimmer than humans, giving them superhuman grace but lower strength. They have long and sharply-pointed ears, and they have similarly sharp and angled facial features. Elves have the same range of skin, hair, and eye colors as humans. Elves of both genders tend to wear their hair long instead of cutting it short. Elves mature many times slower than humans, reaching adulthood at around 50 years old. Elves never age past their physical prime, and they never die of old age.

  ### Elves in Society

  Elves are often envied by humans for their lifespan. At a glance, it's impossible to tell if an elf is 60 years old or a thousand. Even after elves stop aging physically, they continue to age mentally. Younger elves tend to be reckless and confident, while older elves tend to be eccentric and conceited. This mental age often brings the gift of psychic powers, which are more common among elves than any other ancestry. However, as the countless years take their toll, the oldest elves slip towards erratic behavior or outright insanity.

  Most elves live in small, insular communities with like-minded elves. These communities are led by the oldest elves, who are both the most eccentric and the most set in their ways. Some leaders drive their communities to extreme behaviors: some repress all of their emotions, only talk telepathically, or treat trees as people. Many young elves move to human cities to escape their birth communities, rejecting the oppressive elders and their extreme way of life.
