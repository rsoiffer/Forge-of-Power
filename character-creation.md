As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you're starting at, and if they're using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make. 

## Step 1 - General Theme

The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?

In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don't have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.

## Step 2 - Attributes

The next step is to determine your character's attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 4 attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which can range from -2 to +10. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the {% ref Attributes %} page for a description of each attribute.

Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 4. For example, you could start with +3 Strength, -1 Agility, +2 Intellect, and +0 Spirit, since 3 - 1 + 2 + 0 = 4. Write your score in each attribute on your character sheet.

### Improving Attributes

If you're making a level 2 or higher character, your attributes are even higher. For every even level (level 2, 4, 6, etc.), choose to either:
* Increase your highest attribute by 1
* Increase two attributes lower than your highest attribute by 1 each

## Step 3 - Ancestry

Choose one ancestry from the {% ref Ancestries %} page.

## Step 4 - Class Levels

Your character's main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the {% ref Classes %} page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions.

When you create your character, you split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Class Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Novice</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Veteran</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epic</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Talents

Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent's name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent's c;ass.

For example, imagine you are creating a level 5 character. You could choose to put 3 levels in Blaster and 2 levels in Duelist. This makes you a Veteran Blaster and a Novice Duelist. You then learn 3 talents from the Blaster class, all of which must be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 talents from the Duelist class, both of which must be Novice.

As another example, imagine you are creating a level 11 character. You could choose to put all 11 levels in the Arcanist class. This makes you a Master Arcanist. You then learn 11 talents from the Arcanist class, all of which must be Novice, Veteran, or Master.

### Ribbons

In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to classes, and are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.

You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can't pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.

## Step 5 - Feats

Feats are abilities that represent your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn't tied to any specific class. Feats are divided into four categories:
* **General Feats** give you generally useful abilities that don't fit into the other categories
* **Ancestry Feats** give you special abilities related to your ancestry, and always have a specific ancestry as a prerequisite
* **Combat Feats** make you better at combat, giving you damage bonuses to weapons or spells
* **Skill Feats** make you better at skills, giving you bonuses to die rolls for those skills

All combat feats and skill feats give [[Proficiency]] bonuses. These bonuses only stack up to a certain amount depending on your character level. This cap limits the amount you can specialize in one area, so after you reach this cap, it's better to choose other types of feats.

### Starting Feats

Your character starts with two combat feats and four skill feats.

### Extra Feats

You learn one additional feat for each character level, which can be from any category.

## Step 6 - Other Stats

You're now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.

***Health.*** Your Health measures how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your Health is equal to 20 + Character Level + 4 * Strength.

***Defense.*** Your Defense measures how well you can avoid, dodge, or parry physical attacks. Your Defense is equal to 8 + an attribute determined by your [apparel](equipment.html#apparel).

***Speed.*** Your Speed determines how far you can move when you {Stride}. Your character has a Speed of 30 feet.

***Stat DC.*** You have a DC for each of your attributes. This measures how well you can defend against effects targeting that attribute. Your DC for a given attribute is equal to 10 + the attribute.

***Magic & Mana.*** If you can cast spells, you have two special stats, Magic and Mana. Your Magic determines the overall potency of your spells. Your Mana determines how many spells you can cast before running out of magical energy. See the {% ref Mystic Origins %} page for details.

## Step 7 - Equipment

Don't forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (10 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). You can buy any equipment listed on the {% ref Equipment %} page.

## Step 8 - Proficiencies

You can pick up the 10 proficiencies, which include:
* Specific areas of knowledge
* Languages
* Tools
* Musical instruments
* Vehicles

## Step 9 - Aspects

What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of **Aspects**, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Aspects act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for [Setbacks](narrative-rules.html#setbacks). See the {% ref Narrative Rules %} page for details.

When you make your character, you should write down at least three Aspects that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Aspects at any time as your understanding of your character's personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character's Aspects.

***Habits.*** These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.

{% roll_me_one habits %}

***Weird Skills.*** These describe your character's unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.

{% roll_me_one weird-skills %}

***Bonds.*** These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.

{% roll_me_one bonds %}

***Flaws.*** These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.

{% roll_me_one flaws %}

## Step 10 - Backstory

The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you've held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.

## Levelling Up

When you level up, you gain:
* One talent
* One feat
* If it's an odd level, one ribbon
* If it's an even level, one Attribute Score Improvement

In general, whenever you level up, you can change any character build decisions you made earlier, except what classes you have levels in. You can forget talents and learn new talents in their place, change your feats, and so on. Check with your GM before making especially drastic changes when you level up.
