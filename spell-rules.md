Following are more advanced rules related to spells.

## Spell Properties

Most spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you run out of Mana, you can pay this cost from your HP instead; if you do, your current and maximum HP both decrease by the remaining cost. If this decreases your maximum HP to 0, you die. Your maximum HP returns to normal on an 8-hour rest.

Most spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target, it affects one creature you can see within range. If the spell lists an area, the area is centered on a point you can see within range.

## Heightening Spells

You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a maximum Mana cost of Prof + your level in the spell's school.

If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.

## Arcane Backgrounds

When you first put a level in a Mage or Priest power school, you gain one arcane background from the list below. Your arcane background determines your Magic and Mana stats, and gives you unique extra bonuses.

### Cleric

You cast magic spells through faith and devotion to your religion.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Priest power school, choose one spell in that school as your **domain spell** in that school. The Mana cost to cast any of your domain spells is reduced by 1.

### Psion

You cast magic spells through focus and strength of will.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** You don't need a magic focus to cast spells.

### Warlock

You cast magic spells through a bargain with an extraplanar entity.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 1-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you finish an 8-hour rest, you can try to bargain with your patron for more power. Make a Spirit roll against DC 15. On a success, your Mana stat increases by 4. On a failure, your Mana stat decreases by 4. Both effects end when you complete another 8-hour rest.

### Wizard

You cast magic spells through intense study and memorization.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Mage power school, you learn one [[Cantrip]] power from that school. This power doesn't count towards the normal limit of powers you know in that school.
