  brief: Reveal you planned this all along! (change the plot)
  traits: [Daily]
  effect: |
    You announce that you planned this all along! You explain the details of your plan, which retroactively become fact. You cannot change any established events in the story, and your plan must be something that you could have reasonably prepared within the past 24 hours. Your plan cannot involve any actions that would require die rolls to succeed.
    
    For example, if you are investigating a dungeon, you could announce that you remembered to bring 100 feet of rope and a grappling hook, as you had anticipated that you might fall down a chasm. Alternatively, if you are in a meeting with the evil mayor, you could announce that you had arranged for the captain of the guard to be wandering by at just the right time, as you had predicted that the mayor would reveal his plan as this exact time. The GM has final say on whether any plan is reasonable.
