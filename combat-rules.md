Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the {% ref All Powers %} page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.

## Power Properties

Some powers have a **range** in feet. If the power doesn't list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.

Some powers have an **area**. If the power lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the power doesn't list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.

Some powers have a **duration**. When the duration ends, the power's effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the power hadn't been used. Any permanent changes the power made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don't disappear when the power ends. You can't end an ongoing power early unless it specifies that in its duration.

## Surprise

If you start combat with a creature that isn't prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised for the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can't see you, or that otherwise aren't expecting you to attack are {flat-footed} against you.

## Falling

If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet each round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet, up to a cap of 50d6 damage at 500 feet. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land {prone} if you take any damage from a fall.

## Cover

Some environmental features, such as battlements or arrow slits, make it much harder for creatures to hit you with attacks. At the GM's discretion, these environmental features may give you cover from enemies. In general, you have cover from an enemy if at least 3/4 of your body is blocked by a solid object. If you have cover from an enemy, you have a +5 bonus to Defense against their attacks.

## Health

All characters have a Health pool that represents how healthy they currently are. Your Health pool stores a number of points, up to a maximum of your Health stat. When you take damage, you must subtract the damage taken from your Health pool. When you heal, you add the points healed to your Health pool. Your Health pool can never go below 0. While your Health pool is 0, you are {downed}. When you fall to 0 health, or when you take damage while at 0 health, you gain 1 fatigue.

## Fatigue

All characters have a Fatigue track that represents how tired, drained, and unhealthy they currently are. Your Fatigue track stores a number of fatigue points, up to a maximum of 5 fatigue. You start at 0 fatigue. While you are at 3 or more fatigue, you are {slowed}. While you are at 4 or more fatigue, you have disadvantage on all rolls. While you are at 5 fatigue, you are {unconscious}.

## Dying

You die if you're at 0 health and 5 fatigue. Try to not die.
