    You learn the number and location of all magical auras within 120 feet. You vaguely feel the strength of each aura you sense, but you don't learn what is causing each aura. Magical auras emanate from each of the following:
    * A creature that can cast spells
    * A creature, object, or space that is affected by a spell
    * A creature, object, or space that has been affected by powerful spells in the past
    * A creature or object that has been conjured by a spell

Magical Sage:

    skill boost: Arcana
    trigger: You fail (but not critically fail) an Intellect+Arcana roll to learn information about magic
  effect: |
    You learn a hint related to the information you were seeking. In addition, you know exactly where you can go or who you can ask to learn the information.

    The GM determines where or from whom the information could be accessed. If the information is a great secret, the GM could make the place or person with the information be almost completely inaccessible. Information on magic is commonly found at libraries, archives, univeristies, magic shops, and with the people who work in those locations.

    *For example, imagine you roll Intellect+Arcana to identify a magical ward around a noble's house. The GM knows that the ward sends the caster a magical ping if anyone breaks into the house. If you fail the roll, you don't learn this, but might instead learn that the ward is intended as a deterent against burglars. You might also learn that Alice the Artificer, who runs a shop down the street, would be able to easily identify the true nature of the ward if she had a chance to analyze it.*

  tags:
    skill boost: Crafting
    duration: 10 minutes

This rule is retroactively one of the core beliefs of your character's religion. If past events in the campaign contradict this rule, then the rule isn't very important to the average practicioner of your religion.

  traits: [Daily, Retroactive]
  tags:
    skill boost: Society
  effect: |
    Declare something about the history of the game setting. This retroactively becomes fact. Your declaration should be entirely about events that are years in the past, and should not focus on the current state of affairs.

    *For example, you could state that two nations recently emerged from a brutal war, so there's lingering resentment between the two peoples. Alternatively, you could declare that a city built an elaborate series of underground catacombs a century ago, and those catacombs are still around to this day.*

  brief: You are an expert at hiding behind immobile objects, even in the strangest spots
  tags:
    skill boost: Stealth
  effect: |
    You are an expert at placing inanimate objects in the perfect locations. Whenever you hide behind or inside of an inanimate, immobile object, you can slightly adjust this object to perfectly blend into its surroundings. Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.

    *For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant's existence.*

    You have a +10 bonus to the triggering roll. Additionally, you notice a hidden bit of information of the DM's choice about the creatures you're tracking.

Scout Terrain:

  traits: [Daily, Retroactive]
  tags:
    skill boost: Travel
  effect: |
    You declare that a specific terrain feature exists nearby, and that you know the way there. This feature must match the general terrain: you could find a nearby creek if you're in a forest, but not if you're in a desert. The feature is fairly close by, maybe 30 minutes of travel outdoors, or 5 minutes of travel in a city.

    *For example, if you're in a hilly mountain, you could find a nearby cave, cliff, or ravine. Alternatively, if you're in a dense city, you could find a nearby tavern, guard barracks, or temple.*
