Following are more advanced rules related to spells.

## Casting Spells

A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell.

Casting spells requires an **arcane focus**, which is a handheld item you use to channel your magic. You can meditate or focus for 1 hour to designate an item as your arcane focus. Bonding to a new arcane focus severs your connection with your previous focus. You can pick any item as your arcane focus - a staff, a book, a crystal gem, a sword, or so on. You must hold your arcane focus in one hand while casting a spell or using the {Sustain} power.

## Spell Properties

All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. You must always spend at least 1 Mana when you cast a spell, or at least 0 Mana if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.

Some spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.

Some spells have an **area**. If the spell lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the spell doesn't list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.

Some spells have a **duration**. When the duration ends, the spell's effect completely ends. The world returns to its normal state, as if the spell hadn't been cast. Any permanent changes the spell made to the world, such as inflicting or healing damage, don't disappear when the spell ends. You can't end an ongoing spell early unless it specifies that in its duration.

## Heightening Spells

You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a limit of half your character's total Mana.

If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.

## Customizing Spells

Spells are flexible effects, and the caster has significant leeway in choosing how the spell is expressed. A powerful spellcaster who conjures vast firestorms could use that same spell to light a single candle. You can reduce the area, range, duration, or damage of a spell as much as you want when you cast the spell, though the cost stays the same. Ask your GM what other parameters you can change for a given spell. Once you cast the spell, you no longer have direct control over the magic, so you have to pick any changes when you cast the spell.

Players are encouraged to describe their spells differently than how they're described in the rules. For example, instead of describing your {Fireball} spell as an explosion of flames, you could describe it as a flash of lightning, an intense wave of radiation, or as briefly transporting targets to a Hell dimension. Your unique description for your spell is called the spell's Trappings.

Trappings shouldn't change how a spell functions in normal circumstances. The GM might say that Trappings change how a spell acts in unusual circumstances, such as a flash of lightning being more effective than a fireball when the target is underwater. Creatively using spells is cool, and should be encouraged.

## Arcane Backgrounds

When you first reach Novice tier in any power school that has spells, you gain one arcane background from the list below. Your arcane background determines your Magic and Mana stats, and gives you unique extra bonuses.

### Cleric

You cast magic spells through faith and devotion to your religion.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Priest power school, choose one spell in that school as your **domain spell** in that school. The cost of your domain spell is reduced by 1.

### Psion

You cast magic spells through intense focus and strength of will.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** You don't need an arcane focus to cast or sustain spells.

### Warlock

You cast magic spells through a bargain with an extraplanar entity.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 1-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you finish an 8-hour rest, you can try to bargain with your patron for more power. Make a Spirit roll against DC 15. On a success, your Mana stat increases by 4. On a failure, your Mana stat decreases by 4. Both effects end when you complete another 8-hour rest.

### Wizard

You cast magic spells through intense study and memorization.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Mage power school, you learn one [[Cantrip]] power from that school. This power doesn't count towards the normal limit of powers you know in that school.
