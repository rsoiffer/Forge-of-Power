    You are an expert at placing inanimate objects in the perfect locations.

This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.

    For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant's existence.
