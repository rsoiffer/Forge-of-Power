Illusory Disguise:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Spell, Visual]
  tags:
    cost: 1 Mana
    duration: 1 hour
  effect: |
    You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height and weight as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, but held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

    Heightened (total 2 Mana)
    : The spell also disguises your voice and scent, and it gains the [[Auditory]] trait
    
    Heightened (total 3 Mana)

    duration: 10 minutes
  effect: |
    You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object. The entire image must fit within the spell's area. The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. Any creature that touches the image or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

    Heightened (total 2 Mana)
    : Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the [[Auditory]] trait. The duration increases to 1 hour.

    Heightened (total 5 Mana)

  traits: [Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 2 Mana
    range: Touch
    duration: 10 minutes
  effect: |
    Cloaked in illusion, the target becomes invisible. This makes it hidden from all creatures that rely on sight. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends after that action is completed.

    Heightened (total 4 Mana)
    : The spell lasts 1 minute, but it doesn't end if the target uses a hostile action

  effect:
    Your Illusory Object power can form a scene that includes up to 10 moving creatures or objects. You can have each part of the scene follow a repeating program up to 1 minute long. A creature that interacts with one part of your image only disbelieves that portion.

Phantasmal Killer:
  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Death, Emotion, Fear, Mental, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 4 Mana
    range: 120 feet
    save: Will
  effect: |
    You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the target. Only the spell's target can see the killer, though you can see the vague shape of the illusion as it races forth to attack. The effect of the killer is based on the outcome of the target's Will save.

    Heightened (per +1 Mana)
    : The damage increases by 1d6 on a success, by 2d6 on a failure, and by 3d6 on a critical failure
  critical-success: The target is unaffected

    range: 60 feet
    trigger: A spell or magical effect within range deals damage
  effect:
    Exchanging material energy with shadows, you transform the triggering spell into a partially illusory version of itself. Any creatures that would be damaged by the spell instead take only half as much damage, but the spell otherwise works as normal.

  traits: [Mental, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 7 Mana
    range: 30 feet
    duration: Sustained up to 1 minute
  effect: |
    You project an illusory image of yourself. You must stay within range of the image, and if at any point you can't see the image, the spell ends. Whenever you cast a spell, you can cause the spell effect to originate from either yourself or the image. Because the image is an illusion, it isn't a creature and can't benefit from spells. The image has the same AC and saves as you. If it is hit by an attack or fails a save, the spell ends.

    Heightened (total 9 Mana)
    : The maximum duration you can Sustan the spell increases to 10 minutes

Weird:
