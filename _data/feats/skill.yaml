    * A creature, object, or space that is affected by a spell
    * A creature, object, or space that has been affected by powerful spells in the past
    * A creature or object that has been conjured by a spell

  effect: |
    You learn a hint related to the information you were seeking. In addition, you know exactly where you can go or who you can ask to learn the information.

    The GM determines where or from whom the information could be accessed. If the information is a great secret, the GM could make the place or person with the information be almost completely inaccessible. Information on magic is commonly found at libraries, archives, univeristies, magic shops, and with the people who work in those locations.

    *For example, imagine you roll Intellect+Arcana to identify a magical ward around a noble's house. The GM knows that the ward sends the caster a magical ping if anyone breaks into the house. If you fail the roll, you don't learn this, but might instead learn that the ward is intended as a deterent against burglars. You might also learn that Alice the Artificer, who runs a shop down the street, would be able to easily identify the true nature of the ward if she had a chance to analyze it.*

Even if the object would normally be wildly out of place, no one notices the object is strange in any way. This effect ends if the object moves, if the object is a threat or obstacle, or if you are no longer hidden behind or inside of the object.

    *For example, you can hide inside of a box in the middle of the floor, and no one will question why the box is there so long as it stays still. You can hide behind a tall potted plant next to a lava lake in the middle of an evil dungeon, and no one will question the plant's existence.*
