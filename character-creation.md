As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you're starting at, and if they're using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make. 

## Where to Start

The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?

Before you start the rest of character creation, try to imagine the details of what your character will act and feel like. While you don't have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.

Once you have a character in mind, you should go through the other steps on this page in order. Briefly, these steps are:
* Ancestry: Choose your character's race or culture
* Background: Choose what your character did before adventuring
* Classes: Choose your character's special abilities
* Development: Choose extra abilities that your character gets as they level up
* Equipment: Choose your character's starting equipment
* Final stats: Write down the final numerical details on your character sheet
* Narrative: Describe your character's personality and backstory

*At the end of each of the sections below, text in italics gives the exact mechanical steps you need to follow to create your character. If you're in a hurry and you're already familiar with this system, you can skip everything that's not in italics.*

### Building Bruenor

In each of the sections below, I give an example of how to build a character. I use the same example character as D&D 5e: the player Bob is creating his character Bruenor Battlehammer, a dwarven warrior-king who longs to rebuild his lost ancestral fortress of Mithril Hall. Bob imagines Bruenor as a tough frontline warrior who protects his friends, so he stays on the lookout for abilities that will boost Bruenor's defense and melee combat skills.

## Ancestry

Your character's ancestry describes the abilities you gain from your ancestors. This includes biological abilities unique to your character's species, such as a Lizardfolk's mutations or an Undead's physiology. It also includes cultural abilities you learned from the people who raised you, such as a Dwarf's family connections or a Orc's hardiness.

People of different ancestries are adept in different areas. For example, the average Orc is physically larger and stronger than the average Goblin. Your ancestry gives initial values for your four main attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. Your ancestry also gives values for your Speed and Size.

Many ancestries give you additional bonuses or choices. In particular, many ancestries ask you to choose an ancestry feat, which is a special type of power that represents an ability you gained from your ancestry.

*Choose one ancestry from the {% ref Ancestries %} page, and write your choice on your character sheet. Write the stat values given by your ancestry on your character sheet. Note each of the additional bonuses given by your ancestry in the corresponding part of your character sheet.*

### Building Bruenor

Bruenor is a tough mountain dwarf. Bob says that Bruenor has the dwarf ancestry. This means that Bruenor starts with a +0 Strength, Agility, and Intellect, and +1 Spirit. Bruenor also starts with a Speed of 25 feet and a size of 0. Bob writes all of these stats on Bruenor's character sheet.

The dwarf ancestry gives Bruenor two tool proficiencies and an ancestry feat. Bob chooses for Bruenor to be proficient in miner's tools and blacksmith's tools, and Bob chooses the {Dwarven Resilience} ancestry feat. Bob writes the two tool proficiences on the **Proficiencies** section of Bruenor's character sheet, and he notes the feat on the **Powers** page of Bruenor's sheet. Reading the Dwarven Resilience feat, Bob notes 5 [[Poison]] Shield and 5 [[Bludgeoning]] Shield on the **Shields and Weaknesses** section of Bruenor's character sheet so that he'll remember them later.

## Backgrounds

Your character's backgrounds describe what your character did before they became an adventurer. This affects your character's skills, proficiencies, and starting feats. You have two backgrounds, representing skills learned at different parts of your life. For example, your first background might represent your life as a child, and your second background might represent your life as an adult.

Your backgrounds always give you several skill feats and combat feats. These are special types of powers that represent your character's training in various skills and weapons. These feats always come with an extra bonus, called a [[Perk]] bonus, that makes you better at rolls involving the skill or weapon. Depending on your character level, you can't stack too many [[Perk]] bonuses on the same stat, as shown in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Stacking</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 or less</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7 ... 12</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13 ... 18</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>19 or more</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Your backgrounds also give you a number of proficiencies, which represent specialized knowledge in a particular tool, language, or field of study. Proficiencies differ from skills in that they're much more specialized, and won't come up as often in an adventure.

*Choose two backgrounds from the {% ref Backgrounds %} page, and write your choices on your character sheet. Choose the skill and combat feats given by your backgrounds. Write all the feats you chose on your character sheet. Write all the perk bonuses you gained on your character sheet. Choose the proficiencies given by your backgrounds, and write them on your character sheet.*

## Classes

Your character's main ability come from your class, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 20 classes in Forge of Power. See the {% ref Classes %} page for a full list of all classes and their descriptions. Your character is initially level 0 in each class. For each of your character levels, you gain a level in one class of your choice. This means that your character level is equal to the sum of all your class levels. Your character level and your level in a class determine your tier in the class, as shown in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Class Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Novice</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Veteran</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epic</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Talents are the main abilities your character can use. They define your character's combat abilities. Each class has a list of talents. Your character knows a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. All talents have a tier, which is shown next to the talent's name. To learn a talent, you must be at least that tier in the talent's class.

In addition to talents, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are very similar to talents, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities. You learn one ribbon at every odd character level (1, 3, 5, etc.). This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can't pick ribbons from a classes that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.

*Split your character level between the classes. Write your level in each class on your character sheet. Pick a number of talents from each class equal to your level in that class. Make sure you meet the tier requirements for each talent you pick. Write each talent you chose on your character sheet. Pick a number of ribbons equal to half your character level (rounded up), which can be from any class you have levels in. Write each ribbon you chose on your character sheet.*
