# Goblin

Razor Teeth:

As a rough estimate, in one minute of work, you can tunnel through 1 foot of soft material (dirt, sand, plaster) or a few inches of hard material (wood, loose stones, old masonry). You can't tunnel through materials you can't damage, such as solid stone or metal.

The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.
