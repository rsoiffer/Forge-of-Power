brief: Short and hardy folk with a strong community as miners, chefs, and crafters
effect: |
  Dwarves are short and hardy humanoids with a reputation as determined and skilled workers. While they originally came from massive underground fortresses in the mountains, most dwarves now live in urban areas alongside members of all races.

  ### Physical Description

  Dwarves are shorter than humans, and usually stand around 4 feet tall. Dwarves are stouter and denser than their frames might suggest, so they weigh about the same as humans and have similar physical strength. Dwarves live about twice as long as humans, usually 120-150 years. They have the typical range of skin and hair colors, though both male and female dwarves grow long facial hair. Most dwarves braid their beards into long, intricate patterns, often incorporating metal jewlery or rings.

  ### Dwarves in Society

  Dwarves have a reputation as skilled workers, especially in mining, smithing, constructing, cooking, and jewelry. In most cities, the best and most experienced crafters around will all be dwarves. This might come from their cultural work ethic, or perhaps their longer lifespan means they can spend more time perfecting their skills. Every town and city need as many skilled crafters, workers, and merchants as possible, so dwarves are welcomed with open arms in most areas.

  Many dwarves live in tight-knit clans. Dwarves in the same clan protect and support one another. Adult dwarves teach the children of their clan, passing on their professional skills to the next generation. Most marriages are between dwarves of the same clan, so two dwarves in the same clan are more likely than not related to one another through some distant chain of ancestors. Dwarven clans often construct new neighborhoods to live in, so many large cities will have dwarven quarters with amazing architecture and a large population of dwarves.
