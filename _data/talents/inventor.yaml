  brief: Craft a small engine with an elemental effect
  traits: [Manipulate]

    duration: 1 minute after the engine is attached to a weapon, or 1 hour otherwise
  effect: |
    You craft a small magic device that outputs a stream of elemental energy. Choose the engine's element to be one of acid, electricity, ice, fire, magic, or sound. With 1 minute of work, you can set up the engine to perform a single minor effect related to its element, at the GM's discretion.

    When you craft the engine, or as an {% icon 1-Action %} power after you craft the engine, you can attach it to a weapon you touch. Strikes with that weapon deal an extra 1d6 damage. A weapon can only have one engine attached to it at a time.
