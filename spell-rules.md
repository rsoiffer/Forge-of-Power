Following are more advanced rules related to spells.

## Casting Spells

A power with the [[Spell]] trait is called a **spell**. All spells implicitly have the [[Concentrate]] and [[Manipulate]] traits. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell.

## Spell Properties

All spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you don't have enough Mana, you can't cast the spell. Some effects reduce the cost of a spell. The cost of a spell can never be reduced below 1, or below 0 if the spell has the [[Cantrip]] trait.

Some spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target or an area, it targets one creature you can see within range.

Some spells have an **area**. If the spell lists a range, the area is centered on a point you can see within range, otherwise the area is centered on you. If the spell doesn't list a target, it targets all creatures in the area.

## Heightening Spells

You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a maximum Mana cost of Prof + your level in the spell's school.

If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.

## Arcane Backgrounds

When you first reach Novice tier in any power school that has spells, you gain one arcane background from the list below. Your arcane background determines your Magic and Mana stats, and gives you unique extra bonuses.

### Cleric

You cast magic spells through faith and devotion to your religion.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Priest power school, choose one spell in that school as your **domain spell** in that school. The cost of your domain spell is reduced by 1.

### Psion

You cast magic spells through focus and strength of will.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Spirit.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** You don't need a magic focus to cast spells.

### Warlock

You cast magic spells through a bargain with an extraplanar entity.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 1-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you finish an 8-hour rest, you can try to bargain with your patron for more power. Make a Spirit roll against DC 15. On a success, your Mana stat increases by 4. On a failure, your Mana stat decreases by 4. Both effects end when you complete another 8-hour rest.

### Wizard

You cast magic spells through intense study and memorization.

***Magic.*** Your Magic stat equals your Intellect.

***Mana.*** Your Mana stat equals 4 + 2 * the number of spells you know, not counting ribbons. Your Mana pool replenishes when you complete an 8-hour rest.

***Bonuses.*** When you reach Novice tier in a Mage power school, you learn one [[Cantrip]] power from that school. This power doesn't count towards the normal limit of powers you know in that school.
