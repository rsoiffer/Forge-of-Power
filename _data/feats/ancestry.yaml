    By replacing normal conversation with telepathy, you can remove the [[Auditory]] trait from powers you use. Your telepathy doesn't let you communicate with creatures with whom you don't share a language.

You can't tunnel through materials you can't damage, such as solid stone or metal.

    Change the triggering d20 to be a 20 instead of a 1.

Dubious Knowledge:
  tier: Human
  type: 1-Action
  brief: You recount a crazy fact that may or may not be true
  traits: [Daily, Retroactive]
  effect: |
    State a claim or rumor about the world that you have no evidence for but that might plausibly be true. The GM assigns a DC for this claim based on how extreme it is: a reasonble claim would be DC 5-10, a very unusual one might be DC 15, while a crazy or impossible claim would be DC 20 or more. The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.

  type: Passive
  brief: You're really good at pretending to be one faceless mook out of many
  effect: |
    You have a +10 bonus to die rolls to pretend to be a minor, unremarkable member of a large organization.

Natural Talent:
  tier: Human
  type: Passive
  brief: You have a genius talent in your particular field of study
  effect: |

    *As a general rule, this group should have 100 or more members, and most members of the group should agree with your intent as you make the roll. You don't have to be a formally chosen representative or leader of the group, but you do have to be a member.*

# Kami

    2-3
    : No effect

    4-5
    : You are technically the other kami's superior

    6
    : You have direct authority over the other kami
  aside: |
    ### Authority in Heaven

    Kami are obligated to follow reasonable orders given by their technical superiors. Kami are obligated to follow all orders given by people with direct authority over them, no matter how unreasonable. Flagrant abuses of direct authority may attract the attention of the higher-ups.

    If a kami repeatedly disobeys orders they are obligated to follow, they risk being excommunicated from the celestial bureaucracy. An excommunicated kami is analogous to a fallen angel in Christian mythology. They are viewed as evil, heretical, and flawed, and they are totally unwelcome in Heaven.
  fluffstart: |
    You have an elevated status in the celestial bureaucracy, and you have authority over many other kami. Since the celestial bureaucracy is so complex, you often have some kind of authority other any other kami you meet.

Holy Aura:
  tier: Kami
  type: Passive
  brief: You emit a holy aura that harms outsiders and undead
  effect: |
    You are immune to [[Divination]] effects, unless you want them to work on you. Divinations involving you just show a bright white light.

    You have a clan axe, which has the stats of a {bludgeon}, a {heavy weapon}, or a {throwing weapon}. While in combat, you cannot be disarmed of your clan axe. You can show your clan axe to other orcs as a sign of social status, giving you advantage on Spirit rolls to interact with other orcs (except orcs who dislike your clan).

    If you ever lose your clan axe, you always somehow find it again the next day, even if your clan axe was seemingly stolen or destroyed. If you sell or willingly give up your clan axe, you permanently lose this power.

  effect: |
    You fall to 1 health instead.
  fluff: |
    Some orcish youths play a uniquely dangerous game: jump off the highest point you can find, then activate this feat as you hit the ground.

Orcish Inversion:
  tier: Orc
  type: Free
  brief: You defy logic to do even better when the environment fights against you
  tags:
    trigger: You make a die roll while in harsh terrain or weather
  effect: |
    Any penalties the harsh terrain or weather would apply to the triggering roll become bonuses instead. This changes numerical penalties into bonuses and changes disadvantage into advantage. If the GM was increasing the DC of the roll because of the harsh terrain or weather, the GM should instead decrease the DC of the roll by the same amount.

    *For example, if you make an Intellect+Travel roll to track a creature through a blizzard, the DC of the roll would normally be extremely high, maybe +10 above normal. If you use this power, the DC of the roll is instead -10 less than normal.*

# Undead

Detach Body Part:
  tier: Undead
  type: Free
  brief: You can detach your body parts, which continue to function normally
  tags:
    duration: 1 hour, until the body part falls to 0 health, or until you reattach the part
  effect: |
    Choose one body part, such as a hand, an eye, or so on. This body part detaches from the rest of your body, falling to the ground. While detached, the body part continues to function normally: eyes can still see, fingers can still move, and your head can still send orders to the rest of your body. Your body part has 10 Defense and 10 Health.

    Losing body parts limits what your normal body can do. If you detach a hand or arm, you can't wield items in that hand. If you detach a leg or foot, you are {slowed}. If you detach both your eyes, you can't see from your normal body. If your body part is detached when this power ends, you permanently lose that body part. You regenerate lost body parts over the course of 1 week.

    You instinctively know the distance and direction to all your detached body parts. You can use the **Recall Body Part** power.

  type: Free
  brief: You sense the number and location of all nearby living creatures
  tags:
    range: 120 feet
