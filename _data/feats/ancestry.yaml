The GM assigns a DC for this claim based on how extreme it is: a reasonble claim would be DC 5-10, a very unusual one might be DC 15, while a crazy or impossible claim would be DC 20 or more. The GM and the player should agree on the DC. Then, the GM rolls a d20 in secret. If this d20 meets or exceeds the DC, then the claim is actually true, otherwise, the claim is actually false.

    4-5
    : You are technically the other kami's superior

    6
    : You have direct authority over the other kami
  aside: |
    ### Authority in Heaven

    Kami are obligated to follow reasonable orders given by their technical superiors. Kami are obligated to follow all orders given by people with direct authority over them, no matter how unreasonable. Flagrant abuses of direct authority may attract the attention of the higher-ups.

    If a kami repeatedly disobeys orders they are obligated to follow, they risk being excommunicated from the celestial bureaucracy. An excommunicated kami is analogous to a fallen angel in Christian mythology. They are viewed as evil, heretical, and flawed, and they are totally unwelcome in Heaven.

  effect: |
    Choose one body part, such as a hand, an eye, or so on. This body part detaches from the rest of your body, falling to the ground. While detached, the body part continues to function normally: eyes can still see, fingers can still move, and your head can still send orders to the rest of your body. Your body part has 10 Defense and 10 Health.

    Losing body parts limits what your normal body can do. If you detach a hand or arm, you can't wield items in that hand. If you detach a leg or foot, you are {slowed}. If you detach both your eyes, you can't see from your normal body. If your body part is detached when this power ends, you permanently lose that body part. You regenerate lost body parts over the course of 1 week.

    You instinctively know the distance and direction to all your detached body parts. You can use the **Recall Body Part** power.

    *For example, you could detach your eye and roll it beneath a door to watch events on the other side. You could split your body into a number of small pieces to cram into a tight space. You could detach your hand to have it crawl towards someone to creep them out.*
