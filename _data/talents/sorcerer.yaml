# Greater Metamagic:
#   tier: Veteran
#   type: Passive
#   tags:
#     prerequisites: Metamagic
#   effect: |
#     You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.

#     Conservation
#     : If you spend at least 1 Mana on the spell, one spell you cast next turn costs 1 Mana less

#     Overwhelming
#     : The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage

#     Quickened
#     : The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can't use Metamagic again until you take a long rest

#     You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.
#   critical-success: The target disrupts the sphere's integrity, causing it to collapse entirely

# # Old Diviner powers

# Augury:
#   tier: Novice
#   type: 1-Action
#   traits: [Divination]
#   effect: |
#     You gain a vague glimpse of the future. When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:

#     * Weal
#       : The results will be good
#     * Woe
#       : The results will be bad
#     * Weal and Woe
#       : The results will be a mix of good and bad
#     * Nothing
#       : There won't be particularly good or bad results
    
#     The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always "nothing". If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it's possible to get a different result.

# Portent:

#   type: Passive
#   effect: |
#     Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any die roll made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll.

#     Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish an 8-hour rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

#   tags:
#     prerequisites: Portent

#   traits: [Divination, Spell]
#   tags:
#     duration: 10 minutes
