Following are more advanced rules related to combat. See the {% ref All Powers %} page for a list of common actions you can take in combat.

## Surprise

If you start combat with a creature that isn't prepared for an imminent attack, that creature is surprised. A surprised creature cannot use actions during the first round of combat. Creatures that are surprised, that can't see you, or that otherwise aren't expecting you to attack are {flat-footed} against you.

## Falling

If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 5 zones per round. When you fall one or more zones, you take 3d6 damage for each zone you fall, up to a cap of 30d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.

## Health

Your HP can never go above your maximum HP, and your HP can never go below 0. While your HP is exactly 0, you have the {downed} condition.

Some effects can give you temporary HP. When you take damage, subtract the damage from your temporary HP first, then subtract any remaining damage from your HP. Multiple sources of temporary HP **do not** stack, you only keep the highest.

## Dying

When you take damage that brings your HP to 0, you gain the {dying} 1 condition. If this damage was from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save, you instead gain the {dying} 2 condition. While you have the dying condition, you are bleeding out, and you must make a death save at the start of each of your turns.

### Death Save

A death save is a Fortitude save against DC 10.
