      You have advantage on the attack roll if your target is airborne. On a success, your target is knocked back 20 feet.

Elemental Control:

  traits: [Cantrip, Specialize, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 0 Mana

    area: 5-foot burst
    duration: Sustained, up to 1 minute
  effect: |
    Choose one or more objects that are made of the element you specialize in and that are entirely contained in the spell's area. When you cast or sustain this spell, you move those objects to another point within range with perfect accuracy. You can release these objects at speed, throwing objects up to double the normal range of this spell, though not at perfect accuracy.

    These objects can be a small part of a greater whole; for example, you could move a chunk of natural stone even though it is connected to the rest of the planet. By moving many small parts of an object to different positions, you can easily carve or reshape objects.

    You can try to use this power to directly damage a creature, such as by knocking it over with a gust of wind, crushing it with a heavy stone, lighting it on fire, or smashing it with a stream of water. You can use the **Elemental Bolt** power. After you use **Elemental Bolt**, this power ends.

    #### Heightened

    For each +1 Mana, the radius of the burst doubles, the range increases by 20 feet, and the damage of **Elemental Bolt** increases by 2d6.
  specialize:
    Air: |
      Includes pure air and airborne gases. When you move air, you can have the air lift and carry any number of small unattended objects along with it.
    Earth: |
      Includes dirt, stone, sand, crude metal, clay, and brick. When you move earth, you also move all objects or creatures resting on the earth.
    Fire: |
      Includes flames and heat energy. When you cast this spell, you can create a fire in the spell's area, or put out a fire in the spell's area.
    Water: |
      Includes pure water, watery solutions, mist, ice, and snow. When you move water, you can change its phase between mist, water, and ice.

        Success
        : Your target takes 2d6 damage

        If the specialization of **Elemental Control** is Fire, this power is [[Fire]] instead of [[Bludgeoning]].

Homefield Advantage:
  tier: Novice
  type: Free

  tags:
    prerequisites: Any [[Specialize]] Elementalist power
    trigger: You use a [[Specialize]] Elementalist power
  effect: |
    Note the homefield terrain of the triggering power. If you are in the homefield terrain, you gain the following benefits:
    * If the triggering power is a spell, it has -1 cost
    * If the triggering power is an attack and your target is also in the homefield terrain, your attack has advantage
