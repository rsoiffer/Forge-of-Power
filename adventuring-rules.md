Following are rules for interacting with the world.

## Resting

The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal. Stressful activies, including combat or enduring harsh weather, interrupt a rest.

If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any [[Encounter]] powers you have expended. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal an amount equal to half of your Health stat (this effect cannot occur again until you take an 8-hour rest). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal an amount equal to your Health stat, and you recover the ability to use any [[Daily]] powers you have expended.

## NPC Attitude

What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an **attitude** towards the party, which is one of the following values:

Helpful
: The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn't go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life

Friendly
: The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests

Indifferent
: The creature doesn't know you, or doesn't care about you one way or the other

Unfriendly
: The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won't agree to any of your requests

Hostile
: The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way

Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you're fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.
