Following are rules that help groups play out interesting stories.

## Quests

The game is divided into **quests**, each of which has a single well-defined objective. Each quest has a current **Challenge** score, which usually starts at 1. When the party completes a quest, everyone gains XP equal to the questâ€™s Challenge score.

Whenever the GM adds a complication to the quest, they should increase the Challenge by 1. Especially deadly complications might increase the Challenge by 2 or more.

The party can vote to spend 1 Challenge point to introduce a reasonable plot point that makes the quest easier, such as calling in allies to help, or adding a lucky coincidence that works in their favor. The GM determines whether a proposed plot point would be reasonable. Introducing a plot point can only trivialize the quest if it reduces the Challenge to 0.

## Inspiration

Every player has a pool of **inspiration** points that they can spend to influence the story. You can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any die roll that any character makes. When you do, you must explain how your character influences the roll. This can be a very simple way, such as yelling a word of moral support, or 

You start every session with 1 inspiration point. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. You can also earn inspiration through Setbacks, see the section below. Unspent inspiration goes away at the end of a session.

## Setbacks

In books, movies, and shows, we constantly see characters act against their best interests. This makes for interesting, realistic stories of complex, flawed characters. These self-imposed setbacks often act to reinforce the theme of a story. A comedy show relies on exagerrated, silly characters who make humorous mistakes. A grim drama relies on characters with emotional scars that flare up at the worst times.

Forge of Power encourages these stories by compensating players for in-character setbacks. At any time, a player can propose a **Setback**, explaining how a character might act in a way that makes the current quest harder for the entire party. The proposed action has to match the game's theme: if you're running a comedic game, the Setback must be humorous, or if you're running a grimdark game, the Setback must be dark or hurtful. The proposed action must also directly relate to one of the character's Quirks.

The player who controls the character (or the GM, if the character is an NPC) can then choose to accept or reject the proposed Setback. If they accept the Setback, then the proposed action occurs in the game. Both the player who proposed the Setback and the player controlling the character gain 1 inspiration (if you Setback your own character, you gain 2 inspiration). The current quest's Challenge score increases by 1.

Setbacks have a few limitations. First, many Setbacks require an in-character action that can be blocked by other characters. For example, if the reckless character tries to charge into a fight, their party might grab them before they run off. If the action is blocked by other characters, the Setback is cancelled. Second, the same character can't be the cause of a Setback twice in a row. (The same player *can* propose two Setbacks in a row, if they want.) Third, you can't Setback the same Quirk twice in the same game session.
