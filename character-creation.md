As in other tabletop RPGs, before beginning character creation, you should talk with your group about the general setting and style of your game. Ask your GM what character level you're starting at, and if they're using any custom rules. Finally, grab a blank sheet of paper to act as a character sheet, where you can record all the choices you make. 

## Step 1. Choose your General Theme

The first step in making any character is deciding what you generally want your character to be. Will you be a powerful mage, casting arcane spells that reshape reality? A kung-fu master who can somersault and jump between enemies? A hardened soldier with a variety of weapons, who can tough through any situation?

In this step, you should develop these ideas more, working out the details of what you imagine your character will act and feel like. While you don't have to write any of this down, you should keep it in mind as you create the rest of your character. The general theme you have in mind can guide you in choosing what specific powers your character will have, greatly speeding up character creation.

## Step 2. Determine Attribute Scores

The next step is to determine your character's attributes. Characters in Forge of Power have 6 attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Your score in each attribute is a single number, which generally ranges from -1 to +5. The average value of an attribute for a normal human is +0. See the {% ref Attributes %} page for a description of each attribute.

Your starting score in each attribute is a number between -1 and +3. You can choose any starting scores you want such that your scores sum to a total to 6. Write the final values of your attributes on your character sheet.

## Step 3. Choose your Skills

You now choose what skills your character specializes in. Skills are divided into two broad categories. Combat skills, which are always used during combat, represent your experience with types of weapons or magic. General skills represent your ability to perform non-combat tasks of all kinds. See the {% ref Skills %} page for a full list of all skills and their purpose in the game.

Your bonus to each skill is equal to your score in the skill's attribute + your Proficiency in that skill. You start with +0 Proficiency in each skill. Many power schools increase your Proficiency in various *combat skills*. If multiple power schools set your Proficiency in a combat skill, you only take the highest value. You can also get **skill boosts**, which you can apply to a *general skill* to increase your Proficiency in that skill by 2.

You start with 4 skill boosts, which you must apply to different general skills. You gain another skill boost at every odd character level. This means that the total number of skill boosts you have is equal to 4 + half your character level, rounded up. No matter how many skill boosts you apply to a general skill, your Proficiency in that skill can't increase beyond the maximum given in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Proficiency</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ... 4</td>
    <td>+4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 ... 10</td>
    <td>+6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11 ... 16</td>
    <td>+8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>17 or more</td>
    <td>+10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Step 4. Choose your Powers

Powers are a general term for all the special abilities your character has. They cover everything from basic actions to powerful spells. Most of character customizability comes from picking your character's powers.

**Basic powers** are shared across all characters. Your character can use all the powers listed in the {% ref Basic Powers %} page. **Learned powers** are tied to particular power schools and must be learned before you can use them.

All learned powers are part of a power school, which is a group of many thematically-similar powers. There are a total of 24 power schools in Forge of Power. See the {% ref Power Schools %} page for a full list of all power schools and their descriptions.

When you create your character, you split your character level between the power schools. For example, if you have a level 5 character, you could choose to put 3 levels in Telekinetic and 2 levels in Duelist, or you could choose to put all 5 levels in Alchemist. Write your level in each power school on your character sheet.

Your character knows a number of powers from each power school equal to your level in that school. Some learned powers are limited by your character's level and your level in the power's school. All learned powers are listed as Novice, Veteran, Master, or Epic. To learn a power, you must meet the requirements in the table below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>School Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Novice</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Veteran</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epic</td>
    <td>17</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For example, if you have a level 7 character, you could choose to put 5 levels in the Druid school and 2 levels in the Shapeshifter school. You then learn 5 powers from the Druid school, all of which can be either Novice or Veteran. You also learn 2 powers from the Shapeshifter school, both of which must be Novice.

As another example, if you have a level 9 character, you could choose to put all 9 levels in the Diviner school. You then learn 9 powers from the Diviner school, all of which must be Novice or Veteran.

## Step 5. Choose your Ribbons

In addition to powers, your character has several abilities called ribbons. Ribbons are associated to power schools, and are very similar to powers, except that they are generally not very useful in combat. Ribbons are a good way to give your character more theme and flavor without impacting your combat capabilities.

You learn one ribbon at every odd character level. This means that the total number of ribbons you know is equal to half your character level, rounded up. You can't pick ribbons from a power school that you have no levels in, but there are no other restrictions on which ribbons you can choose.

## Step 6. Choose your ASIs/Feats

Your character becomes stronger in other ways than simply learning more powers. At every even level, you can choose to either get an Attribute Score Improvement (ASI) or a feat. This means that the total number of ASIs or feats you get is equal to half your character level, rounded down. This represents your character becoming stronger generally, in a way that isn't tied to any specific power school.

If you choose to get an ASI, you increase your score in one attribute by 1 point, to a maximum of +5.

If you choose to get a feat, you learn one feat from the {% ref Feats %} page.

## Step 7. Compute Miscellaneous Stats

You're now almost finished making your character! The only game mechanics task remaining is to write down a few numbers describing various aspects of your character.

***Character Level.*** Your character's level describes your overall strength. Most characters are between levels 1 and 20, but this isn't a hard limit. The GM determines what level your character is.

***HP.*** Your hit points (abbreviated as HP) measure how much damage you can take before falling unconscious. Your HP is equal to 20 + Character Level + 2 * Constitution.

***Mana.*** Your Mana measures how many spells you can cast before running out of energy. Your Mana is equal to Character Level + 2 * Intelligence, to a minimum of 0 Mana.

***Initiative.*** Your Initiative measures how quick you are to react to combat. Your Initiative is equal to your Dexterity.

### Defenses

Your character has several stats that describe how well you can defend yourself against all kinds of threats, physical, magical, or otherwise. These stats are called the four Defenses.

- ***Agility.*** Your Agility measures how well you can dodge or avoid physical dangers. Your Agility is equal to 10 + max(Strength, Dexterity). Agility can be used to defend against [[Physical]] [[Attack]] powers.

- ***Toughness.*** Your Toughness measures how well you can withstand physical trauma. Your Toughness is equal to 10 + max(Strength, Constitution). Toughness can be used to defend against [[Physical]] [[Attack]] powers.

- ***Resilience.*** Your Resilience measures how well you can resist effects that corrupt your body. Your Resilience is equal to 10 + max(Constitution, Wisdom). Resilience can be used to defend against [[Corrupting]] [[Attack]] powers.

- ***Willpower.*** Your Willpower measures how well you can resist effects that corrupt your mind. Your Willpower is equal to 10 + max(Wisdom, Charisma). Willpower can be used to defend against [[Corrupting]] [[Attack]] powers.

## Step 8. Buy Equipment

Don't forget to buy equipment to use in your adventures! You start with (100 * your character level) gold pieces (gp). See the {% ref weapons %} and {% ref armor %} pages for stats. More tables for standard adventuring gear and magic items are on the way.

## Step 9. Describe your Personality

What your character will choose to do is as important as what your character has the power to do. Every player character has a list of **Quirks**, which are unique personality traits or flaws that define them. Your Quirks act as a guide to help you roleplay your character, and are useful for [Setbacks](narrative-rules.html#setbacks).

When you make your character, you should write down at least three Quirks that make you stand out. Feel free to add, modify, or remove Quirks at any time as your understanding of your character's personality changes. The categories and random generators below can help give you ideas for your character's Quirks.

***Habits.*** These describe the obvious character actions that makes your character stand out from the average adventurer.

{% roll_me_one habits %}

***Weird Skills.*** These describe your character's unique skills in strangely specific tasks, things you do better than anyone else.

{% roll_me_one weird-skills %}

***Bonds.*** These describe the causes your character cares deeply about, the fundamental beliefs that drive you to act. They also describe the personal connections your character has with family, close friends, loved ones, organizations, or even special items.

{% roll_me_one bonds %}

***Flaws.*** These describe character flaws that may impede your character and provide a source of narrative conflict.

{% roll_me_one flaws %}

## Step 10. Write your Backstory

The final step in making a character is figuring out how you reached the start of the adventure. You should write down some basic notes about where your character was raised, any previous jobs you've held, and how you met the rest of the party. Your backstory is also the perfect place to introduce the NPC contacts that your character knows. The more detail you write, the better your GM will be able to merge this detail with the campaign setting.
