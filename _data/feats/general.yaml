Blind Fighter:
  type: Passive
  brief: You are an effective fighter even when you're unable to see

    As long as you can hear and feel, you can sense objects within 30 feet as well as if you could see.

    Low [visibility](combat-rules.html#visibility) (including the {dazzled} and {blinded} conditions) has no effect on you. If are {blinded} or have no vision, you still critically fail Notice rolls that rely on seeing objects more than 30 feet from you.
  fluff: |
    The GM should give this as a free feat to all permanently blind player characters.

You can communicate telepathically with your familiar while it is within 60 feet of you. Your familiar loyally follows any orders you give it, unless those orders are obviously suicidal.

    If your familiar dies, you can resummon it with a 1-hour ritual.

Innate Focus:
  type: Passive
  brief: You can cast spells from your body instead of from an arcane focus
  tags:
    prerequisites: A mystic origin
  effect: |
    You don't need to wield an arcane focus in order to cast spells. Choose one type of magical weapon, such as [orbs](equipment.html#orb) or [staves](equipment.html#staff). If a combat feat for this weapon lists a requirement of the form "you are wielding this weapon", you ignore that requirement.

  tags:
    prerequisites: Any [[Specialize]] power

Sympathetic Mage:
  type: Passive
  brief: You can cast magic through totems that represent specific creatures
  tags:
    prerequisites: A mystic origin
  effect: |
    You can craft a sympathetic totem that represents another creature, much like a voodoo doll or a religious statuette. Crafting such a totem requires 1 hour of work, plus one of the following components:
    * A small piece of the creature, such as a hair, a toenail, or a drop of blood
    * A prized possession of the creature, such as a family heirloom or a favorite weapon

    When you target a sympathetic totem with a spell, you can choose for the spell to instead target the creature represented by the totem. The totem has the [[Fragile]] trait, so if the spell is an attack, and if the attack roll critically fails, the totem breaks.

    Your maximum health increases by an amount depending on your character level, as given in the following table.
