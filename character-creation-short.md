## Quick Reference

### Reference Tables

You can't use attribute boosts to increase your score in any attribute above the maximum given below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Attribute Score</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 or less</td>
    <td>+3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4 ... 7</td>
    <td>+4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8 ... 11</td>
    <td>+5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12 ... 15</td>
    <td>+6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16 ... 19</td>
    <td>+7</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20 or more</td>
    <td>+8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

No matter how many skill boosts you have in one skill (even though you might get many from skill feats), your bonus in the skill can't exceed the maximum below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Max Skill Bonus</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 or less</td>
    <td>+2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7 ... 12</td>
    <td>+4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>13 ... 18</td>
    <td>+6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>19 or more</td>
    <td>+8</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To learn a talent of a specific tier in a class, you need to have both the required level in the class and the required overall character level.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tier</th>
    <th>Character Level</th>
    <th>Class Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Novice</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Veteran</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Master</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Epic</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>7</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following terms are important for character creation.

***Attribute.*** Your character has four attributes: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Spirit. You add one of these whenever you make a die roll.

***Attribute Boost.*** An attribute boost increases your score in one attribute by 1. You can't pick an attribute boost that increases your score in an attribute above the maximum given in the table to the right.

***Class.*** A [class](classes.html) is a group of thematically similar abilities. Characters are primarily defined by their classes.

***Feat.*** Feats are powerful abilities that don't come from a class. There are four types of feats: [General](feats-general.html), [Ancestry](feats-ancestry.html), [Combat](feats-combat.html), and [Skill](feats-skill.html). Some abilities ask you to pick a feat of a specific type.

***Proficiency.*** [Proficiencies](proficiencies.html) are specific topics that people might know a lot about. Proficiencies do nothing on their own, they just help describe your character's knowledge.

***Ribbons.*** Ribbons are minor abilities that come from a class. Ribbons are usually more useful for roleplay than combat.

***Skill.*** A [skill](skills.html) is a broad activity that characters can be good at. When you make a die roll related to a skill's activity, you add your bonus to the skill (in addition to the attribute).

***Skill Boost.*** A skill boost gives you a +2 bonus whenever you make a die roll with a particular skill. If you have multiple skill boosts for the same skill, add the +2 for each of them, up to the maximum given in the table to the right.

***Talent.*** Talents are powerful abilities that come from a class. Each talent has a tier (Novice/Veteran/Master/Epic). To learn a talent of a tier higher than Novice, you must have at least a required character level and level in the talent's class, as given in the table to the right.

## Pick an Ancestry

An ancestry is a character's species and culture. Your ancestry gives you several basic abilities (which are shared by all characters of that ancestry), and it lets you pick ancestry feats corresponding to that ancestry.
* Pick an [ancestry](ancestries.html).
* Note the starting values of your attributes.
* Note your Speed and Size stats.
* Note your traits. Some effects work differently on creatures with certain traits.
* Read each of the basic abilities given by your ancestry.
* If an ability asks you to pick a ribbon, pick a ribbon from the given class.
* If an ability asks you to pick an ancestry feat, pick a feat from the list at the bottom of the ancestry's page.

## Pick Two Backgrounds

Backgrounds are a character's past or current professions, other than adventuring. Each background gives you a skill feat and three proficiencies.
* Pick two [backgrounds](backgrounds.html).
* For each, pick a skill feat for the given skill. Note the skill boost given by each feat.
* For each, note the proficiencies given by the background.

Your life experience also gives you a basic familiarity with several skills and weapons.
* Pick four attribute boosts.
* Pick two [skill feats](feats-skill.html). Note the skill boost given by each feat.
* Pick two [combat feats](feats-combat.html).
* Pick a lore [proficiency](proficiencies.html) for a specific settlement or terrain you lived in.
* Pick any one [proficiency](proficiencies.html).

**Optionally**, you can pick an attribute flaw, decreasing one of your attributes to increase another. If you choose to have an attribute flaw:
* Decrease your score in one attribute by 1.
* Pick an attribute boost.
* Make sure that one of your Aspects (see the last section on this page) describes the attribute you decreased.

## Level Up

For each character level, you pick a level in one class, which gives you one talent from that class. As your character levels up, they also gain other bonuses, depending on whether it's an odd level or an even level.

For each odd level (1/3/5/etc.):
* Pick a [class](classes.html) to gain a level in.
* Pick a talent from that class.
* Pick a feat. If this feat is a skill feat, note the skill boost given by the feat.
* Pick a ribbon. This ribbon can be from any class you have at least one level in.

For each even level (2/4/6/etc.):
* Pick a [class](classes.html) to gain a level in.
* Pick a talent from that class.
* Pick an attribute boost.
* Pick a skill boost.

## Pick a Mystic Origin (Spellcasters Only)

The following section only applies to spellcasters. Your character is a spellcaster if you know any spell (a power with the [[Spell]] trait). Spells are common in the Mage and Priest classes, and some combat feats are spells. See the {% ref spell rules %} page for details.

If you are a spellcaster, you need to pick a mystic origin, which describes the source of your magic power. Also, your **Caster Level** is defined as your total level in all Mage or Priest classes.
* Pick a [mystic origin](mystic-origins.html).
* Note your Magic stat, which is either Intellect or Spirit. You add this attribute whenever you make a Magic roll.
* Calculate your Mana stat. This is usually equal to 4 + 2 * Caster Level.
* Calculate your Mana Limit stat. This is equal to 1 + half Caster Level.
* Note when you replenish your mana. This is usually when you complete an 8-hour rest.
* Read your mystic origin's special ability.

## Pick your Equipment

Your equipment is all the items you own. For adventuers, your most important equipment is the apparel you wear as protection and the weapons you wield in combat.
* Start with 10gp for each character level. *I haven't written prices yet, so pretend all items are free.*
* Buy your [apparel](equipment.html#apparel). To maximize your Defense stat, you may want to buy apparel that corresponds to your highest attribute.
* Buy your [weapons](equipment.html#weapons). If you have a combat feat for a weapon, you may want to buy that weapon.
* Buy any miscellaneous items you want.

## Calculate your Final Stats

Write down all the following values on your character sheet:
* For each attribute, calculate your DC in that attribute. This is 10 + your score in that attribute.
* Calculate your Health stat. This is 10 + 5 * Character Level + 5 * Strength.
* Calculate your Defense stat. This is given by the apparel you're currently wearing.
* Note all the Shields or Weaknesses you have, if any.

## Describe your Personality

Last but not least, you need to describe your character's personality.
* Write down between three and ten aspects. Each aspect is a 2-5 word phrase that describes part of your character's personality.
* Tell the GM your character's backstory.
