  tags:
    cost: 4 Mana
    range: 120 feet
  effect: |
    Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing or holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see. If you attempt to bring another creature with you, the power fails.

    Heightened (total 5 Mana)
    : The range increases to 1 mile, and you don't need to be able to see your destination, as long as you have been there in the past and know its relative location and distance from you

  type: Passive
  tags:
    prerequisites: Metamagic
  effect: |
    You can modify your spells in a broad variety of ways. Your Metamagic power gains the following options.

    Conservation

    Overwhelming
    : The spell ignores any resistances to acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage

    Quickened
    : The spell takes 2 fewer actions to cast, but the strain involved means you can't use Metamagic again until you take a long rest

Resilient Sphere:
  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Force, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 4 Mana
    range: 30 feet
    duration: 1 minute
  effect:
    You create an immobile sphere of force to either trap or protect the target, blocking anything that would pass through the sphere. The sphere has AC 5, Hardness 10, and 40 HP. It's immune to critical hits and precision damage. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Reflex save, with the following effect.

    area: 30-foot burst
    duration: 1 minute
  effect:
    You change the direction of gravity in the area. Creatures and objects that aren't secured to the ground immediately fall towards the new direction you designate as down. Rules for falling and fall damage apply as normal. A creature partially inside the area is caught between normal and redirected gravity, and is pulled in both directions at once.

Reflect Spell:
  tier: Master
  type: Passive
  tags:
    prerequisites: Counterspell
  effect:
    When you use Counterspell to counteract a spell that affects targeted creatures or an area, you can turn that spell's effect back on its caster. When reflected, the spell affects only the original caster, even if it's area spell or it would normally affect more than one creature. The original caster can attempt a save and use other defenses against the reflected spell as normal.

Metamagic Mastery:
  tier: Epic
  type: Passive
  tags:
    prerequisites: Metamagic
  effect:
    Altering your spells doesn't take any longer than casting them normally. You can use Metamagic as a Free power.

  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 10 Mana
  effect:
    You temporarily stop time for everything but yourself, allowing you to use several actions in what appears to others to be no time at all. Immediately after using this power, you take 3 turns. Rounds only pass for you, effects specifically targeting or affecting you, and effects you create during the stoppage. All other creatures and objects are invulnerable and can't be targeted or affected by anything. Once you have finished your turns, time begins to flow again for the rest of the world.

# Old Diviner powers

Augury:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Divination]
  effect: |
    You gain a vague glimpse of the future. When you cast this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveals the GM's best guess among the following outcomes:

    * Weal
      : The results will be good
    * Woe
      : The results will be bad
    * Weal and Woe
      : The results will be a mix of good and bad
    * Nothing
      : There won't be particularly good or bad results
    
    The GM secretly rolls a d4. On a 1, the result is always "nothing". If anyone casts Augury again to ask about the same topic, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting, though if circumstances change, it's possible to get a different result.

Guidance:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  tags:
    range: 30 feet
    duration: Until the start of your next turn
  effect:
    You see briefly into the future, granting the target a +1 bonus to one die roll they attempt before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling, after which the spell ends. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

True Strike:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Fortune]
  tags:
    duration: Until the end of your turn
  effect:
    A glimpse into the future ensures your next blow strikes true. The next time you make an attack, roll the attack twice and use the better result. The attack ignores any penalties to the roll.

Portent:
  tier: Novice
  type: Passive
  effect: |
    Glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish an 8-hour rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any die roll made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll.

    Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish an 8-hour rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.

Clairvoyance:
  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Divination, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 4 Mana
    range: 500 feet
    duration: 10 minutes
  effect:
    You create an invisible floating eye at a location within range (even if it's outside of your line of sight). The eye can't move, but you can see in all directions from that point as if using your normal visual senses.

Read Omens:
  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Divination, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 4 Mana
  effect:
    You peek into the future. Choose a particular goal, event, or activity that will occur within 1 week. You learn a cryptic clue or piece of advice that could help with the chosen event, often in the form of a rhyme or omen.

Greater Portent:
  tier: Master
  type: Passive
  tags:
    prerequisites: Portent
  effect:
    The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll four d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.

True Seeing:
  tier: Master
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Divination, Spell]
  tags:
    duration: 10 minutes
  effect:
    You see things within 60 feet as they actually are. Within that range, you automatically disbelieve all illusions, see invisible creatures, and see the true forms of all polymorphed creatures.

Foresight:
  tier: Epic
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Divination, Mental, Spell]
  tags:
    cost: 9 Mana
    duration: 1 hour
  effect: |
    You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall you. You gain a +2 bonus to Initiative rolls and you aren't flat-footed against hidden creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following power.

    ### Foresight {% icon Reaction %}
    ---
    Trigger
    : You defend against a hostile creature or other danger

    ---
    If the hostile creature or danger forces you to roll dice, you roll twice and uses the higher result, and this power gains the [[Fortune]] trait. But if the hostile creature or danger is rolling against you, that hostile creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this power gains the [[Misfortune]] trait.
